# 🛡️ GRC Compliance and Risk Management

This section demonstrates governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) practices aligning with NIST cybersecurity standards. It includes core documents that simulate a real-world compliance and audit program in an enterprise environment.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Develop a complete Risk Register tracking likelihood, impact, and mitigation
- Map security controls using a NIST 800-53 Control Matrix
- Track compliance gaps with a detailed Audit Checklist
- Define policy coverage with an 'Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)'
